# Fake-Number-Plate-Detection
This project is made during my Internship at ISRO. This Machine Learning Model basically detects the manufacturer and model of a vehicle and then detects it's number plate and extract the number on the number plate to compare the corresponding model and manufacturer. If they matches it's a legal number plate otherwise it's fake.
